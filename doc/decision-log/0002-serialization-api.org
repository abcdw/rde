#+TITLE: Serialization API
#+Date: 2023-03-13

* Status
RFC by 2023-03-20

* Context
Many different home services and some other modules use same target
configuration format and it seems logical to extract serialization to a
separate module, in rde we have (rde serializers ...).

All of them have slightly different number of functions exposed with slightly
different return values, and to make it more consistent it's necessary to
define a shared API.

* Decision
For each serializer module we will provide:

- FORMAT-serialize :: a public function returning a g-expression, which
  produce a string being written to configuration file.
- FORMAT-merge :: a public function taking two or more configurations and
  merging them into one with respect to underlying format.
- FORMAT-config? :: a public function for checking if provided data looks
  suitable for this format.

* Consequences
We get unified API across serializers modules.
