@node Introduction
@chapter rde

First of all rde is a developer and power user friendly GNU/Linux
operating system, ready for use with a few to zero tweaks.  Let's call
this part @dfn{rde system}.

Sometimes, it can be treated as an Emacs distribution, but while GNU
Emacs is an important part, in reality rde manages not only Emacs, its
packages and configurations, but other user space software too, let's
call this part @dfn{rde home}.  In addition to that, it can be used to
manage home environments (@pxref{Home Configuration,,, guix,}) on the
operating system other than rde or Guix.

@c TODO: Part about per-project rde tools.

@quotation
The project is in an active development stage, API is a subject to
change, watch rde-devel mailing list to be up to date with the latest
news.
@end quotation

While rde is ultimately hackable and can be completely changed and
customized according to someone's needs, features, programs and
configurations provided out of the box has a strong opinionated flavor
and follows a number of principles (@pxref{Principles}).  It's not
possible to cover all existing free software, provide sane
configurations and integrate it in rde, so we picked a tool for each
area based on its technical capabilities, interoperability with the
other programs and our own taste.  Focusing on only one tool for each
job, we can provide good defaults, integrate it deeply with the rest
of the system and make it pleasant and effortless to use, but due to
flexible design it is always possible to substitute it with other
alternative, however it can require some or a lot of work and
additional knowledge on the user side.

Take a brief look on the list of some tools we picked:
@include rde-tool-list.texi

@node Principles
@section Principles

@subsection Main

@table @asis
@item Ergonomic
Sane keybindings, good contrast, readable fonts.
@item Reproducible
Setup can be easily replicated.
@item Hackable
Easy to throw out or modify any part of setup.
@item Stateless
All state must be explicit and syncable or temporary.
@end table

@c @node Secondary
@subsection Secondary

@table @asis
@item Lightweight
Not only because of undepowered hardware, but also cause of
simplicity.  Slim solutions easier to understand, debug and fix.
@item Energy and battery efficient
wayland, fast native apps.
@item Offline
most of workflows and apps should work without network.
@item Peaceful
Attention-friendly, minimal use of notification and other distractive
things.
