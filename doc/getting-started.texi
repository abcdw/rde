@section Trying it
There are several ways to get a taste of rde.

@subsection rde Live Image
The primary one is to get the latest ISO image, write it to DVD or USB
stick, boot from it and try it.

The image is available here:

@c @value{WEB-PAGE}/current-live/amd64/rde-live-latest-amd64.iso
@value{ISO-URL}

To set keyboard layout open an emacs @kbd{s-@key{RET}}, open eshell
@kbd{s-e} and type the following commands:

@example
swaymsg 'input type:keyboard xkb_layout "us,ru"'
swaymsg 'input type:keyboard xkb_variant "dvorak,"'
@end example

After all or some of the corners of live operating system are explored,
you can proceed with installation (@pxref{Installation}).
Alternatively, you can use a current Guix System installation and just
use rde on top of it, the steps will be similiar.

@subsection rde home on Foreign Distro
The secondary option is to use rde on already existing non-Guix
operating system with @command{guix} command available.  On Debian
GNU/Linux and derivatives Guix can be installed and started in two
commands:

@example
sudo apt update && sudo apt install guix
sudo systemctl start guix-daemon
@end example

After that you can use rde home as usual or even proceed with full
operating system installation (@pxref{Installation}).

@subsection rde as a Channel
Some advanced users may prefer to use only parts of rde they are
interested: features, services, or just packages.

In that case you can add the following channel to @file{channels.scm}.

@example
(cons*
 (channel
  (name 'rde)
  (url "@value{GIT-REPO}")
  (introduction
   (make-channel-introduction
    "257cebd587b66e4d865b3537a9a88cccd7107c95"
    (openpgp-fingerprint
     "2841 9AC6 5038 7440 C7E9  2FFA 2208 D209 58C1 DEB0"))))
 %default-channels)
@end example
