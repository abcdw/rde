@section Trying it
There are several ways to get the taste of rde.

@subsection rde Live Image
The primary one is to get the latest ISO image, write it to DVD or USB
stick, boot from it and try it.

The image is available here:

@c @value{WEB-PAGE}/current-live/amd64/rde-live-latest-amd64.iso
@value{ISO-DIRECTORY-URL}

Download it, write to flash drive and boot from it.

@example
sudo dd if=@value{ISO-NAME} of=/dev/sdX status=progress
sync
@end example

By default qwerty and dvorak layouts are available.

To set other keyboard layouts open Emacs @kbd{s-@key{RET}}, open eshell
@kbd{s-e}, adjust to your preference and type the following commands:

@example
swaymsg 'input type:keyboard xkb_layout "us,ru"'
swaymsg 'input type:keyboard xkb_variant "dvorak,"'
@end example

After all or some of the corners of live operating system are explored,
you can proceed with installation (@pxref{Installation}).
Alternatively, you can use a current Guix System installation and just
use rde on top of it, the steps will be similiar.

@subsection rde home on Foreign Distro
The secondary option is to use rde on already existing non-Guix
operating system with @command{guix} command available.  On Debian
GNU/Linux and derivatives Guix can be installed and started in two
commands:

@example
sudo apt update && sudo apt install guix
sudo systemctl start guix-daemon
@end example

After that you can use rde home as usual or even proceed with full
operating system installation (@pxref{Installation}).

@subsection rde as a Channel
Some advanced users may prefer to use only parts of rde they are
interested: features, services, or just packages.

In that case you can add the following channel to @file{channels.scm}.

@example
(cons*
 (channel
  (name 'rde)
  (url "@value{GIT-REPO}")
  (introduction
   (make-channel-introduction
    "257cebd587b66e4d865b3537a9a88cccd7107c95"
    (openpgp-fingerprint
     "2841 9AC6 5038 7440 C7E9  2FFA 2208 D209 58C1 DEB0"))))
 %default-channels)
@end example

@anchor{Installation}
@section Installation

For now this section will be just a bare minimum to get started, later
more details will be added.

@subsection Writing Config
The simpliest way is to take example configuration, explore it and edit
according to your needs.  Live image contains @file{~/rde-configs},
which is a real-world full-blown rde configuration.

The other option is to craft the configuration from scratch, take
rde-config record declaration from example configuration and remove all
the features and start adding them one by one, expanding the scope
covered by the configuration.

@subsection Applying Config
There is a @file{Makefile} in example configuration, it contains various
targets for reconfiguration, building and initialization of home
environment, operating system and guix profiles, use them directly or
just as an example to create your own targets.  To navigate through the
list of targets can use @code{imenu} (@kbd{M-g i}).  To actually run the
target use @code{compile} emacs command, just type @kbd{M-x compile RET}
and type the name of the target, after you started typing part of the
target name, corfu (@pxref{Corfu}) will show a tooltip with a list of
available options.

Most of the targets uses @code{$@{GUIX@}}, which points to the
@command{guix} binary, it helps to make sure builds are reproducible,
but you need to create this binary by calling @code{make
rde/profiles/guix}, it will generate a guix binary based on the content
of @file{rde/channels-lock.scm}.  After that feel free to experiment
with other targets.

On foreign system you are mostly interested in @code{*/home/*} targets,
but if you manage your whole operating system with GNU Guix pay
attention to @code{*/system/reconfigure} or if installing a fresh OS
take a look at @code{cow-store} and @code{*/system/init} targets.

To get more information about installation process read @xref{Manual
Installation,,, guix,}, skip unrelated sections like keyboard
configuration and keep in mind that we already have @code{cow-store} and
@code{*/system/init} targets in Makefile for you.

Happy hacking, see you in a bit in the next section.
