;;; Comment:
;;;
;;; symlink-manager cares about configuration files: it backs up files
;;; created by user, removes symlinks and directories created by a
;;; previous generation, and creates new directories and symlinks to
;;; configuration files according to the content of files/ directory
;;; (created by home-files-service) of the current home environment
;;; generation.
