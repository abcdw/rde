* TODO Questions
- Do we want to use ~!~ in commit messages?
- What is a better format for new feature commit message?
- Add links to the info/websites?
- How to split long list of changelog items into more manageable pieces?
- Check out https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.org

* Notes
Items starting with ~!~ means BREAKING CHANGES.  It's not a dump of commit log,
it's carefully crafted list of items, which usually takes some of commit
messages as a foundation.
