* rde emacs
Set of reasonable configurations for emacs & packages.

** Principles
In addition to rde principles:
- Vanilla :: Stick to defaults, where possible, change something if it
  necessary.
- Simple :: Prefer simplier and more composable packages to
  "full-fledged" complex combines.
- Consistent :: Prefer emacs way solution to more fancy modern
  approaches, for consistent and pleasant user experience.
- Non-distractive :: No flashy/shiny/jumping around stuff.

** Tips
*** Getting all the help
Read how to read [[info:info#Top][info]] format. Learn basics and advanced topics reading
[[info:emacs#Top][Emacs]] manual. Use ~C-h C-h~ to learn help hotkeys. ~C-h f~ to explore
available functions, ~C-h v~ to explore available variables, ~C-h k~
to learn what is called on particular keybinding.
** Additional keybindings
rde emacs tries to stick to vanilla keybinding, if it necessary to
declare new combination it tries to use as /emacsy/ keys as possible,
for example: project related command will go under ~C-x p~ prefix.
Frequently used commands can go under ~s-~ prefix, for example: ~s-e~ can
call ~eshell-toggle~.
