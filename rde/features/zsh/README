* Principles
- Snappy :: Performance is important, shell should be fast and
  snappy. CPU-intensive task shold be asyncronous.
- Emacsy :: Hotkeys, completion behavior and other stuff should be
  close to emacs.
- Self-contained :: zsh config should utilize mostly zsh features.
  Plugins or external utilities should be easy to remove.

* Important hotkeys 
** Abort zsh action ~C-g~
** Abort command ~C-c~ or clear the input
** Clear the line ~C-u~ 
** Search the history or autocompletion ~C-r~ and ~C-s~
** Look up manual for the current command ~M-h~
** Undo ~C-/~
