*Disclaimer:* The rde project is stable and usable, but still under active
development and API is a subject to change.

** Principles
This is a brief list of principles, more detailed description can be found in
the [[https://trop.in/rde/manual#Principles][manual]].
*** Main
- Ergonomic :: Sane keybindings, good contrast, readable fonts.
- Reproducible :: Setup can be easily replicated.
- Hackable :: Easy to throw out or modify any part of setup.
- Stateless :: All state must be explicit and syncable or temporary.
*** Secondary
- Lightweight and battery efficient :: wayland, fast native apps.
- Offline :: most of workflows and apps should work without network.
- Attention-friendly :: minimal use of notification and other
  distractive things.

** Usage
Read [[https://trop.in/rde/manual#Getting-Started][Getting Started]] section of the manual, skim through the source code and
enjoy the thing!

** Channel introduction
In case you want to use rde as a channel, there is a channel definition:

#+begin_src scheme
(cons*
 (channel
  (name 'rde)
  (url "https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde")
  (introduction
   (make-channel-introduction
    "257cebd587b66e4d865b3537a9a88cccd7107c95"
    (openpgp-fingerprint
     "2841 9AC6 5038 7440 C7E9  2FFA 2208 D209 58C1 DEB0"))))
 %default-channels)

Add it to ~~/.config/guix/channels.scm~, and call ~guix pull~ or manage it any
other way you want.

** Guix Home
~Guix Home~ is a part of GNU Guix now, no additional installation steps are
required anymore.

*** People's Guix Home configurations
Those repositories are not affilated with rde or Guix, they are provided as
real-world Guix Home usage examples, but be careful and thoughtful, remember
that blindly copying snippets of code from the internet can have a huge
security implications on your setup.

- [[https://hg.sr.ht/~yoctocell/guixrc/browse/yoctocell/home][yoctocell]]'s full-blown configuration with variety of software.
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~krevedkokun/dotfiles/tree/master/item/config/home/yggdrasil][krevedkokun]]'s Emacs(Evil)/Wayland(Sway) compact and clean config.
- [[https://github.com/nicolas-graves/dotfiles][Nicolas Graves]]' dotfiles forked from krevedkokun's.
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~akagi/guixrc][akagi]]'s configurations, home and system services and packages.
