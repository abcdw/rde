*Disclaimer:* The project is in an active development stage.

** Principles
More detailed description can be found in the [[https://trop.in/rde/manual#Principles][manual]].
*** Main
- Ergonomic :: Sane keybindings, good contrast, readable fonts.
- Reproducible :: Setup can be easily replicated.
- Hackable :: Easy to throw out or modify any part of setup.
- Stateless :: All state must be explicit and syncable or temporary.
*** Secondary
- Lightweight and battery efficient :: wayland, fast native apps.
- Offline :: most of workflows and apps should work without network.
- Attention-friendly :: minimal use of notification and other
  distractive things.

** Usage
rde heavily relies on Guix Home and Guix System, it's able to provide
both a ~home-environment~ and ~operating-system~ records, which can be
used by ~guix home~ and ~guix system~ respectively.  It's not ready for
wide audience yet, but for very curious people: my current [[file:rde/examples/abcdw/configs.scm][config]] is
here and I use following commands to apply it:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde
cd rde
make home
#+end_src

Read more about ~home-environment~ at [[http://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/en/guix.html#Home-Configuration][Home Configuration]].

GNU Guix and git should be installed before invoking commands above.

The alternative and more apropriate way to use rde will be described
later.

** Guix Home
~Guix Home~ is a part of GNU Guix now, no additional installation steps
are required.

*** People's Guix Home configurations
Those repositories are not affilated with rde or Guix, they are provided as
real-world Guix Home usage examples, but be careful and thoughtful, remember
that blindly copying snippets of code from the internet can have a huge
security implications on your setup.

- [[https://hg.sr.ht/~yoctocell/guixrc/browse/yoctocell/home][yoctocell]]'s full-blown configuration with variety of software.
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~krevedkokun/dotfiles/tree/master/item/home/yggdrasil][krevedkokun]]'s Emacs(Evil)/Wayland(Sway) compact and clean config.
- [[https://github.com/nicolas-graves/dotfiles][Nicolas Graves]]' dotfiles forked from krevedkokun's.
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~akagi/guixrc][akagi]]'s configurations, home and system services and packages.

** Channel introduction
In case you want to use rde as a channel, add the following code to
your ~~/.config/guix/channels.scm~, and call ~guix pull~.
