* rde
Set of tools for managing computing environments with GNU Guix. More
info is available at [[http://trop.in/rde][trop.in/rde]].

*Disclaimer:* The project is in an active development stage.

*Tip:* older Nix source code is available under ~stale/~ directory.

** Principles
*** Main
- Ergonomic :: Sane keybindings, good contrast, readable fonts.
- Reproducible :: Setup can be easily replicated.
- Hackable :: Easy to throw out or modify any part of setup.
- Stateless :: All state must be explicit and syncable or temporary.
*** Secondary
- Lightweight and battery efficient :: wayland, fast native apps.
- Offline :: most of workflows and apps should work without network.
- Attention-friendly :: minimal use of notification and other
  distractive things.

** Usage
rde heavily relies on Guix Home and Guix System, it's able to provide
both a ~home-environment~ and ~operating-system~ records, which can be
used by ~guix home~ and ~guix system~ respectively.  It's not ready for
wider audience yet, but for very curious people I will say that my
current [[file:rde/examples/abcdw/configs.scm][config]] is here and will write down following commands:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde
cd rde
make
#+end_src

Read more about ~home-environment~ at [[https://guix-home.trop.in/Home-Configuration.html][Home Configuration]].

GNU Guix should be installed before invoking command above.

Also, for now Guix Home is not a part GNU Guix and have to be
installed manually. When it will become upstreamed the installation
step won't be needed.

** Guix Home
*** Installation
**** Option 1
The primary way to use Guix Home now is to set ~GUILE_LOAD_PATH~ to
the directory, where the guile code for it is located.
~./pre-inst-env~ script in the root of rde folder is doing exactly
that, just prefix any command with it, like:

#+begin_src shell
./pre-inst-env guix home --help
#+end_src

**** Option 2
Another possible option is to add rde repo as a channel, but you still
need to run at least on ~guix home reconfigure~ with correct
~GUILE_LOAD_PATH~ as mentioned above or:

#+begin_src shell
GUILE_LOAD_PATH=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/guix/current/share/guile/site/3.0:$GUILE_LOAD_PATH
guix home reconfigure ./PATH_TO_FILE_WITH/HOME_ENVIRONMENT.scm
#+end_src

After you installed your first home environment, your shell is
properly configured (See [[https://guix-home.trop.in/Configuring-the-Shell.html][Configuring the Shell]]) and you did relogin or
reboot, you should be able to use ~guix home~ without setting
anything.

*** People's configurations
- [[https://hg.sr.ht/~yoctocell/guixrc/browse/yoctocell/home][yoctocell]]'s full-blown configuration with variety of software.
- [[https://git.sr.ht/~krevedkokun/dotfiles/tree/master/item/cfg/home/asgard.scm][krevedkokun]]'s Emacs(Evil)/Wayland(Sway) compact and clean config.

** Channel introduction
In case you want to use rde as a channel, add the following code to
your ~~/.config/guix/channels.scm~, and call ~guix pull~.
#+begin_src scheme
(cons*
 (channel
  (name 'rde)
  (url "https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde")

** Contributing
*** New features, fixes or ideas
Send mails, optionally with inline patches to rde-devel mailing list.

*** Documentation
For Guix Home documentation for now maintained in [[https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/guix][forked Guix
repository]] inside ~doc/guix.texi~ and deployed to
https://guix-home.trop.in/Home-Configuration.html once in a
while.  Patches to rde-devel is a good option here too.
