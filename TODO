** TODO Implement a standard way to create common configuration file formats
Some programs use the standard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file][INI configuration format]], e.g. XDG
desktop entries, Notmuch.  Git uses a it's own variant of the INI
format, other formats like JSON, TOML, and YAML are also pretty
common.  See ~lib.generators~ in [[https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/blob/master/lib/generators.nix#L1][Nixpkgs]].
