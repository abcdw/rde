https://emacs-guix.gitlab.io/website/manual/latest/emacs-guix.html#Development
https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Coding-Style
Add copyrights to source code
** TODO Cleanup utils module
Split into utils and configuration related helper?
** QUESTION Add home-services to service or keep them separate?
* ~guix home~ Before Upstream Checklist
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
** TODO Make system service for Guix Home
Allows to make home-environment a part of operating-system and thus
use without ~guix home~ subcommand.
** TODO Make it possible to specify the verbosity for ~guix home reconfigure~
By default, only the path to the home environment should be shown,
~/gnu/store/...-home~.
** Finished

*** DONE Make symlink manager to check
if the file is modified by user before removing it, even if it already
under the control of guix home.
*** DONE Rewrite on-first-login script to guile
*** DONE Check it works on debian
*** DONE Implement zsh home-service
*** DONE Implement bash home-service
*** DONE Implement gnupg home-service
*** DONE Call on-reconfigure on reconfigure
*** DONE Add ~guix home search~
*** DONE Add ~list-generations~
*** DONE Add ~guix home roll-back/switch/delete~
*** DONE Fix environment-variables service
It's enough to make it accept pairs, it doesn't have to be list,
because value can be a gexp.
*** DONE Add XDG support to home-envirnoment
Set explicitly XDG_CONFIG_HOME and friends.
*** DONE Run ~guix home~ on 5 early adopters
**** DONE Establish/define support channels and schedule
Define schedule and add the information to announce.
- #guix IRC.
- rde-discuss mailing list.
- beweekly calls.
**** DONE Announce in rde-announce
**** DONE Announce in guix-devel
**** DONE Announce on stream
*** DONE Discuss xdg-flavor? default to #t
*** DONE Establish documenting workflow (write guideline)
*** DONE on-reconfigure -> activation
Refactor on-reconfigure service, it should be activation service,
because this script can be called on generation switch event and not
only on reconfigure.
*** DONE Add provenance
To make ~guix home describe~ more informative.
*** DONE Make activation script create ~/.guix-home symlink
It will also allow to make correct run-on-change implementation.
*** DONE Add ~guix home init~ command for migrating from ~~/.guix-profile~
Similar to ~guix package --export-manifest~, and maybe detect existing
config files and generate template for home services configurations.
E.g. if ~~/.bashrc~ exists, add ~home-bash-service-type~ to ~services~
field of ~home-environemnt~.

creation.

*** TODO Remove previous rde implementation

~rde/config.scm~ is a ready to use configuration, but requires few
helpers to make it customizable by the end user.
