To get sudo authorization with yubikey work, it's necessary to setup
second slot of key to following settings:

#+begin_src shell
sudo ykpersonalize -2 -ochal-resp -ochal-hmac -ohmac-lt64 -oserial-api-visible -ochal-btn-trig
#+end_src

Create a challenge-response state file for connected key in your home directory.
#+begin_src shell
ykpamcfg -2 -v
#+end_src
