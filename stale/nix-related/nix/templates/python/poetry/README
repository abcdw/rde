Python will be available after initialization.

> poetry init && poetry lock

> poetry add PACKAGE-NAME

If you use nix develop, don't forget to rerun it.

To be able to build package with `nix build .` you need to add script section to
`pyproject.toml` first. https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#scripts
